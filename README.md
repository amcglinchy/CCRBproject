CCRB Project


An exploratory visualization of the makeup of the NYPD members of service and the number of complaints against them. My goal for this project was to create an engaging, aesthetically pleasing and highly interactive visualization, allowing the user to explore the data and draw their own conclusions. The data for this project comes from the Civilian Complaint Review Board, made available on NYC OpenData. For my purposes, I’ve only included officers with the status of currently active within the past year, and only those with at least one total substantiated complaint against them. Users can see the number of complaints against each service member and also sort them by race, rank, or gender.


The Civilian Complaint Review Board is an independent agency that investigates and recommends action on complaints made against New York City police members of service. Specifically the dataset I used is “A list of all NYPD officers, as reported to CCRB by NYPD based on NYPD's roster, and a count of any complaints they have received since the year 2000.” This entire dataset includes over 88.3 thousand officers and 18 thousand with a currently active status, which was incredibly too much to handle for my purposes. So, I decided to whittle it down by only including officers with the status of currently active within the past year, and only those with at least one total substantiated complaint against them.
